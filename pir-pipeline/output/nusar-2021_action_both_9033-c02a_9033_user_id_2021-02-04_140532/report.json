This disrupts the mechanical linkage and cascades failures downstream by misconfiguring the arm's attachment points.\n\nPHYSICAL ANALYSIS:\nThe arm connector must attach to the chassis before it can be linked to the boom, violating the correct assembly hierarchy. Connecting it to the boom prematurely undermines the structural integrity of the arm assembly. Immediate consequences include misaligned components and unstable assemblies. Cascade failures occur because subsequent steps depend on the correct placement of the arm connector, leading to improper linkage and potential collapse of the entire structure.\n\nROOT CAUSE:\nThe operator erroneously prioritized attaching the arm connector to the boom instead of the chassis, disregarding the established assembly hierarchy. This error stems from misunderstanding the sequential dependencies required for proper mechanical linkage.\n\nSEVERITY: CRITICAL\nCORRECTIVE ACTION:\n1. Identify all instances of arm connectors and chassis in the assembly graph.\n2. Reverse the erroneous attachment of arm connectors to the boom and reattach them to the chassis.\n3.
